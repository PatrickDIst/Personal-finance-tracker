PROJECT DESCRIPTION 

Personal finance tracker

My personal finance tracker is a custom-built application designed to help users manage their income, 
expenses, and savings. It allows users to categorize transactions, set budgets, and track financial goals over time. 
The project focuses on delivering a simple, user-friendly interface with clear data visualization to support better financial decision-making.
